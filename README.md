# Hacking Dash

You'll need [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/).

To get started working with Dash, you should be working in the `tests` build.

Start up the local dev server using figwheel:

```bash
lein figwheel test
```

Direct your browser to [`localhost:3449/index_test.html`](http://localhost:3449/index_test.html).  Happy hacking!
